Welcome to the **ninth problem** of the React 30+ Practical Problems series! In this challenge, we will create a component that changes its background color dynamically when clicked.

### Problem 9: Dynamic Background Color Changer 🎨

Build a React application with a `ColorChanger` component to demonstrate dynamic style changes.

**📝 Problem Description**

Create a React component that changes its background color every time the user clicks on it. The color should be selected randomly from a predefined set of colors.

Key features:

- The `ColorChanger` component should start with a default background color.
- On clicking the component, the background color should change dynamically.
- Use React's `useState` hook to manage the current background color.
